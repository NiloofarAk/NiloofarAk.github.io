            <h2>Multilingual Image Captioning with Attention Mechanisms</h2>
            <p>I worked with another master student on image captioning using the MSCoCo dataset and translated captions into Persian. We modified a TensorFlow implementation of the Show Attend and Tell model and trained it on Google Colaboratory's GPU. The dataset will be published soon.</p>
