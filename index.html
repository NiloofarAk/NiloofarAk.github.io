            <p>Currently, I am a student pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Concordia University. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I served as a Teaching Assistant, enriching my understanding of the subject matter while assisting fellow students. My primary research interests lie in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Engineering, areas in which I have gained practical experience. I am always open to learning new technologies and frameworks. Programming is what I enjoy.</p>
